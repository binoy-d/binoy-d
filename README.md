### Hi! I'm Daniel, a developer and 2nd-year CS Student at UC Irvine.

I love designing and programming  beautiful, functional applications and interfaces that have a real impact on users. Whether its writing code, filming videos, or creating art, I'm always making something. Connect with me to make something great, together! 

# What I'm doing:
 - ICSSC : In the ICS Student Council Project Committee, I am working on rebuilding zotistics.com, a grade distribution visualization tool, in React
 - Curicular: Currently redesigning and optimizing the curicular.com website for faster load times and better customer retention as a Web Developer/UI Design Intern
 - KTBYTE: I teach Processing and Java remotely to kids from ages 8 to 17 and help develop/refine curicula
 - Badger Meter: Will be starting as a Software Enginnering Intern in Jan 2021, working with Python, React, and AWS
 - Personal Projects: I'm always working on my own little projects and maintaining past projects. Check out my commits!
